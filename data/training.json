      "q": "Which licence should I get first?",
      "a": "For most people, the RePL (Remote Pilot Licence) is the best starting point. It's comprehensive, doesn't expire, and opens up the most opportunities. Choose in-class for hands-on learning or online for flexibility."
    },
    {
      "q": "What's the difference between in-class and online RePL training?",
      "a": "In-class training offers hands-on practical experience with direct instructor interaction over 5 intensive days ($2,500-$3,500). Online training provides flexibility with self-paced learning and virtual components ($1,800-$2,800). Both result in the same CASA-approved certification."
    },
    {
      "q": "How long does training take?",
      "a": "RePL in-class training takes 5 intensive days. Online RePL is self-paced, typically completed in 2-4 weeks depending on your schedule. RPA accreditation can be completed online in a few hours."
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the legal penalties for unlicensed flying?",
      "a": "Flying commercially without proper accreditation can result in fines up to $11,100. Always ensure you have appropriate licensing before commercial operations."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I switch between in-class and online training?",
      "a": "Contact our training team to discuss switching options. Some flexibility may be available depending on your progress and course availability."
